# Algorithms-DataStructures
This repository is a collection of popular searching and sorting algorithms
for the purpose of practice, studying, and reference.

It will be added to over time as I learn more.

The data structures will just pretty simple as far as data types, usually using type integer for simplicity
but I will try to make them as generic as possible, creating them with a generic data type.

Feel free to add!

Happy coding!
